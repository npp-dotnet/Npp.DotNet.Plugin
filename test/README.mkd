Npp.DotNet.Plugin.Tests
-----------------------

### Memory

This is currently the only test project.
It checks the alignment of some potentially problematic Scintilla structures.
It was inspired by past issues caused by wrongly sized fields in the CLR `struct` used to hold notification data.

See:
