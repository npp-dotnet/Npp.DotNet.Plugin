Npp.DotNet.Plugin.Tests
-----------------------

### Buffers

Checks that [ClikeStringArray] allocates enough memory for unmanaged UTF-16 strings.

> [!Important]
> The test class depends on a C++ library that must be built separately with the Visual C++ toolchain.
> To do that, start the [Developer Command Prompt or PowerShell] and run:
>
>     msbuild /t:Build /p:Configuration=Debug|Release /p:Platform=x64|ARM64 test\Buffers\Unmanaged
>

### Memory

Checks the alignment of some potentially problematic Scintilla structures.
It was inspired by past issues caused by wrongly sized fields in the CLR `struct` used to hold notification data.
